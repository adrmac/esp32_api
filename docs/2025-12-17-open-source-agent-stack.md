I spent some time this week sorting out a free / open source stack for adding RAG / LLM based on ESP32 temperature / humidity data.
 
## Ollama 
Downloads open source models and runs them locally
* Ollama directory of models available: https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding&q=embed 
  
## LLMs 
Pretrained models that generate conversational responses to prompts, and can be constrained to specific domains and structured outputs
* gemma2 - Google’s open weight LLM
* llama3 - Meta’s open weight LLM, NOT related to Ollama
* gpt-oss - Open AI’s open weight LLM 
  
## Text embedding models 
Small dedicated models for converting text to vectors so an LLM can read them.
* bge-m3 
* nomic-embed-text
  
## LangChain 
Agent development framework with standardized types and language wrapper (python and typescript variants) 
* langchain-ollama integration 
* langchain-text-splitters - packages for splitting up PDFs and websites as embeddable chunks of text with metadata

## LlamaIndex
Alternative agent development framework (also with python and typescript variants)
* llama-index-llms-ollama integration
* SentenceSplitter, SimpleWebPageReader, SimpleDirectoryReader split up PDFs and websites

## PostgreSQL 
* supabase - not open source but generous free tier cloud db  
* pgvector - python extension that enables SQL similarity search
* chromaDB - more advanced storage option specifically for vectors -- for now using supabase / pgvector  instead
  
## RAG bibliography 
Starter literature corpus on the subject of indoor environmental data for the LLM to consult when providing an answer
